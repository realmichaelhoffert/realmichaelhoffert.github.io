I am a deeply curious individual with a passion for discovering and describing the mechanisms shaping the diverse ecosystems that have surrounded me, visible or invisible, throughout my life. From the lush forests of Vermont and the cool shield lakes of Canada to the resilient prairies of Minnesota and inside the human body, my drive to understand my environment has pushed me towards three major scientific interests:

### The impact of disturbances on microbial community evolution and composition over time
Microbiology has only scratched the surface in describing the selective forces which shape microbial communities over time. I am passionate about defining the selective forces behind functional adaptation events observable at both the population and genomic levels, especially when selective pressures change in response to environmental disturbances. I want to use the evolutionary fingerprint of disturbances on functional potential to describe how disturbances shape community composition over time.


### Biogeography and community assembly
blah blah something smart




### Bioinformatics and computational biology platform development
High-quality biological data - DNA sequencing or otherwise - has never been more inexpensive or abundant. I believe that the computation tools and infrastructure available to scientists for data processing, analysis, and reproducibility are critical elements of modern biology. As data volume and analysis complexity continue to increase, my interest in computation tools and techniques that visualize large volumes of biological data have been joined by a fascination with HPC and bioinformatics pipeline infrastructure. In particular, I am interested in contributing to projects that facilitate access and reduce usability barriers in HPC environments used for biological data processing.
