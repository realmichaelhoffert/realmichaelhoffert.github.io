Here's a summary of my scientific interests.

### Ecological interactions which shape microbial community composition and evolution surrounding disturbances
Microbiology has only scratched the surface in describing the selective forces which shape microbial communities over time. I am passionate about defining the selective forces behind functional adaptation events observable at both the population and genomic levels, especially when selective pressures change in response to environmental disturbances. I want to use the evolutionary fingerprint of disturbances on functional potential to describe how disturbances shape community composition over time.


### Biogeography and community assembly
blah blah something smart




### Bioinformatics and computational biology platform development
High-quality biological data - DNA sequencing or otherwise - has never been more inexpensive or abundant. I believe that the computation tools and infrastructure available to scientists for data processing, analysis, and reproducibility are critical elements of modern biology. As data volume and analysis complexity continue to increase, my interest in computation tools and techniques that visualize large volumes of biological data have been joined by a fascination with HPC and bioinformatics pipeline infrastructure. In particular, I am interested in contributing to projects that facilitate access and reduce usability barriers in HPC environments used for biological data processing.
