I am a deeply curious individual with a passion for discovering and describing the mechanisms shaping the diverse ecosystems that have surrounded me, visible or invisible, throughout my life. From the lush forests of Vermont and the cool shield lakes of Canada to the resilient prairies of Minnesota and inside the human body, my drive to understand my environment has pushed me towards three major scientific interests:

### The impact of disturbances on microbial community evolution and composition over time
Microbiology has only scratched the surface in describing the selective forces which shape microbial communities over time. I am passionate about defining the selective forces behind functional adaptation events and community composition shifts observable at both the population and genomic levels, especially when these adaptations and compositional changes are induced by shifts in selection after disturbances. I am fascinated by the evolutionary and compositional fingerprints left on microbial communities which identify the changes in selection occurring in a post-disturbance regime, and whether these changes in selection predict (or don't predict!) the continual assembly of a microbial community.
* Read about my [Senior Integrative Exercise at Carleton](/work-samples/#comps-presentation), where I discovered my excitement for examining selective pressure surrounding disturbances
* [My work with Dr. Rika Anderson at Carleton College](/experience/#anderson-lab) explores how evolutionary patterns at the genome level indicate the presence of environmental selection

### Biogeography and community assembly
The question of community assembly is essential to ecology: why are certain species in certain places? I am intrigued by the interplay between deterministic and stochastic effects that result in an organism's introduction to a new environment or population as a candidate for colonization or reproduction. I am particularly interested in identifying how deterministically assembled communities and populations evolve differently from stochastically assembled ones, and how these communities and populations continue to change over time. I think that enumerating the specific environmental and genetic conditions which enable or disrupt colonization and gene flow between populations and environments can provide insight to the composition and community over time.
* I discuss the balance of deterministic and stochastic factors influencing community assembly in my [Senior Integrative Exercise at Carleton](/work-samples/#comps-presentation)
* Read about my work in [meta-analysis of the human gut in IBD](/experience/#the-human-microbiome-in-ibd), which expanded on the idea of selection-specific community assembly

### Conceptual models in ecology
I am drawn to ecology because ecology integrates information from evolutionary studies, organismal biology, environmental data, and many other topics to synthesize ideas about how organisms interact with one another to form dynamic ecosystems. While well-defined biological concepts (e.g. the driving mechanisms of evolution defined as "natural selection") allow us to formulate questions and predict the outcomes of biological processes, the absence of such well-defined principles in ecology hinders our ability to predict the response of ecosystems to an increasingly turbulent and disturbed environment. Whether mathematical, physical, or purely conceptual, I am driven to define models and methods that helps us understand and refine investigation into the evolution and composition of ecosystems over time.
* Having trouble understanding what kind of models I want to build? So am I. That's why I'm applying to graduate schools!

### Bioinformatics and computational biology platform development
High-quality biological data - DNA sequencing or otherwise - has never been more inexpensive or abundant. I believe that the computation tools and infrastructure available to scientists for data processing, analysis, and reproducibility are critical elements of modern biology. As data volume and analysis complexity continue to increase, my interest in computation tools and techniques that visualize large volumes of biological data have been joined by a fascination with HPC and bioinformatics pipeline infrastructure. In particular, I am interested in contributing to projects that facilitate access to HPC tools and reduce usability barriers in HPC environments used for biological data processing.
