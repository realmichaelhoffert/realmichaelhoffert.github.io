# Education
![Graduation](/images/graduation.jpg){: .align-left}
After graduating from [U-32 High School](https://www.wcsu32.org/Domain/8) in 2014, I attended [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/), where I majored in Biology with a concentration in Biochemistry and an unofficial minor in Computer Science (it's complicated). My education at Carleton involved advanced courses in evolution, biochemistry, ecology, genomics, algorithms, computation biology, and computer programming. I also was a [TA](/experience/#carleton-prefect-program), varsity athlete on the Student Athletic Advisory Committee, Biology Student Departmental Advisor, and [professional science dish washer](/experience/#biology-stockroom). I graduated in 2018 with a B.A. after earning Distinction on my [Senior Comprehensive Project](/work-samples/comps/).

# Athletics
![Race](/images/MH_XC_3.jpg){: .align-right}  
The outdoors aren't only an inspiration for my career as a scientist, but are also an outlet for my energy. The activities I pursue outside of my work are my way of testing my limits and discovering beautiful places wherever I go. Running, skiing (Nordic, but recently my crashing skills have found a new calling on the slopes), and biking form a year-round schedule of activities that ensure I never get bored. After competing in Nordic skiing, Ultimate Frisbee, and running in high school, I joined Carleton's NCAA DIII cross-country and track teams, where I was a team co-captain. Since then, I've hung up the spikes and focused my need for speed on mountain biking.
  
  

# Fishing and the outdoors
I love to fish, an activity I pursue year-round in both fly-fishing and traditional formats. I'm a big fan of finding big smallies on submerged structure during hot summer days in Vermont and New Hampshire's deep lakes, brook trout in remote streams, and pursuing Master Angler status in my home state of Vermont. In addition to fishing, I love to hike in the Green Mountains, White Mountains, ride my bike, and generally fool around outside.
