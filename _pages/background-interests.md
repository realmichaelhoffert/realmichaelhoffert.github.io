### Introduction
I grew up in a rural town in Central Vermont, raised by an Army-officer-turned-baker and an aspiring interior decorator. I now live in Watertown, Massachusetts.

### Education
After graduating from [U-32 High School](https://www.wcsu32.org/Domain/8) in 2014, I attended [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/), where I majored in Biology with a concentration in Biochemistry and an unrecognized minor in Computer Science (it's complicated). My education at Carleton involved advanced courses in evolution, biochemistry, ecology, genomics, algorithms, computation biology, and computer programming. I also was a [TA](/experience/#carleton-prefect-program), varsity athlete on the Student Athletic Advisory Committee, and [professional science dish washer](/experience/#biology-stockroom). I graduated in 2018 with a B.A. after earning Distinction on my [Senior Comprehensive Project](/work-samples/#comps-presentation).

### Athletics
Growing up a tiny house with 3 siblings, the outdoors weren't only for inspiration. Running, skiing (Nordic, but recently my crashing skills have found a new calling on the slopes), and biking have sustained my energy, tested my willpower, and fueled my love for nature year-round. After competing in Nordic skiing, Ultimate Frisbee, and running in high school, I took my skills to Carleton and enjoyed a moderately successful career as a NCAA DIII athlete and team co-captain. Since then, I've hung up the spikes and focused my need for speed on mountain biking. Let's talk bikes.

### Fishing
Every year, I've found time to travel to Southern Ontario to relax in a boat and catch some fish. I am extremely passionate about fishing, an activity I pursue year-round in both fly-fishing and traditional formats. I'm a big fan of finding big smallies on submerged structure during the hot days of Northeastern summers (when I have the most time to fish), remote streams (and the fish that occupy them), and pursuing Master Angler status in my home state of Vermont.
