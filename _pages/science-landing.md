## Science
A desire to explore and explain the world around me is the foundation of my interest in science. Although my role as an ecologist has recently been focused on microbial communities, I am excited to explore any system where I can learn about environmental disturbances as ecologically significant events, the shifts in community evolution and composition induced by dynamic environmental and interspecific interactions, and how communities assemble, change, and evolve over time.

## Experience

From evolutionary research in hydrothermal vents to building drugs that rescue the human gut from IBD, my experiences at Carleton College and Finch Therapeutics span an array of topics and contexts.
