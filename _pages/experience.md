# Full-time scientist at Finch Therapeutics: June 2018 - present
**Manager:** Rotem Gura Sadovsky  
**Team Lead:** Sonia Timberlake  
I began in my role as a Bioinformatics Research Associate on Finch Therapeutics' Data Science team in June of 2018. As part of the Data Science team, I work in an extensively collaborative environment, combining insights from my teammates, bench scientists and clinicians at Finch to perform high-throughput analysis of multi-omics microbiome data from patients in a variety of disease indications. My role, which was expanded with a promotion Bioinformatics Research Associate II in June of 2020, also means that I assist in computational analysis method development, perform end-to-end implementation and validation of bioinformatics pipelines, and orchestrate meta-analysis projects as part of the Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder and Clostridium difficile (CP101) programs.

## Analyzing the human microbiome in IBD
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD), collectively form the class of heterogeneous gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As part of the microbial candidate discovery process for in Finch's [Rationally Selected Microbiota](https://finchtherapeutics.com/platform) therapy in IBD, I have reviewed, accessed, and processed data dozens of public and proprietary datasets constituting thousands of samples and billions of reads for meta-analysis. This is involved building and validating version-controlled and scalable bioinformatics pipelines to quality-filter DNA sequences, remove contaminant DNA, quantify strain abundances, with high-performance parallelized architecture. In addition to After processing and assembling databases of strains abundance, I set out to quantify strains
