## Focus on Extremes
I've spent my time as a researcher studying ecosystems that represent extremes in the world of microbial ecology. [My experience at Finch Therapeutics](/experience/#full-time-scientist-at-finch-therapeutics) as part of a team developing live microbial therapeutics is on the cutting edge of biotechnology and microbiology applications and analysis in human health. [The research projects from my undergraduate career](/experience/#anderson-lab) represent literal extremes: I used multi-omic data to study microbial evolution in boiling hot, ultra-deep hydrothermal vents. My work described the dynamics that dictate how life arose and differentiated on our planet and how it may do the same on others. The fascinating microbiomes from the human gut to the deep ocean have developed my technical and scientific skillsets and fueled my drive to identify the ecological mechanisms that tie these ecosystems together.

## How Things Work
I'm driven first and foremost by curiosity, and a "How It Works" approach is the hallmark of my scientific (and extracirrucular!) interests. I'm not only focused on describing ecological dynamics, but generalizing the mechansisms of these dynamics and returning to the data to explain it using my ideas. Why are certain clades of gut microbes enriched in IBD? What geochemical data explains differential selection in the pangenomic features of _Methanothermococcus_ archaea? These are only two of the questions that my research has addressed, but the answers to each have contributed an insight that explains patterns of community assembly and evolution observed in many ecosystems.

## In addition to science...
I'm not a researcher by chance: my curiosity and love of discovery translate into the activities I pursue outside my workday. The perfect example is fishing. The combination of presentation, context, weather, gear and knowledge required to catch a fish are a match (pun intended) for a person who pursues this kind of complexity for a career. The rush of seeing an monster smallmouth come out of the deep plays into it too. I'm also an ex-NCAA runner, a data visualization and HPC geek, and an novice mountain biker.
