excerpt: "I'm an aspiring ecologist interested in studying how species assemble and co-exist with one another in complex and dynamic ecosystems. I approach these problems with a multidisciplinary computational skillset developed during my time as a bioinformatics researcher at [Finch Therapeutics](https://finchtherapeutics.com/) in Somerville, MA and during my undergraduate studies in the [Biology Program at Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/biology/)."
